# Data 606 - Data Science Captsone Project 

### Project - Image Captioning

Dataset - Multiple Sources(Kaggle, OpenSource etc) 
Dataset Size - 9 GB

This project will train the model to caption the image. For Eg. If a person is lauging in the picture, Model will predict the same and give the caption. 

Applications:
- For people with visual aid - Blind
- Google search

Planning to use NLP to train the model using CNN, RNN models. Will need to research more on which model to use.

This can be developed as a web application. On the web app, user can upload the image and once it is successfully uploaded, our model will predict the caption for it.
